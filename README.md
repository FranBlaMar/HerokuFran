croodle
=======
Croodle is a web application to schedule a date or to do a poll on a general topics. Stored data is encrypted/decrypted in the browser using 256 bits AES.

This is an alpha version. It is **not** for use as a publicly available service at this stage. Especially protection against DNS-attacks on the server is not implemented yet.

Croodle is inspired by ZeroBin: https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin and of course by Doodle.
